        <h1><strong>GYM</strong></h1>
        <strong>what is a gym</strong>
      <P> A gym, short for gymnasium (pl.: gymnasiums or gymnasia), is an indoor venue for exercise and sports. 
 The word is derived from the ancient Greek term "gymnasion".
 They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centres, and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions.
    "Gym" is also the commonly used name for a "fitness centre" or health club, which is often an area for indoor recreation.
     A "gym" may include or describe adjacent open air areas as well.<br> In Western countries, 
     "gyms" often describe places with indoor or outdoor courts for basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing or wrestling, 
      and with equipment and machines used for physical development training, or to do exercises. In many European countries,
     Gymnasium (and variations of the word) also can describe a secondary school that prepares students for higher education at a university,
     with or without the presence of athletic courts, fields, or equipment.</P>

     <em><U>about physical fitness</U></em>
     <P>Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations, and daily activities.
         Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and sufficient rest along with a formal recovery plan.
Before the Industrial Revolution, fitness was defined as the capacity to carry out the day's activities without undue fatigue or lethargy.<br> However, 
with automation and changes in lifestyles, physical fitness is now considered a measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities,
 to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases, to improve immune system function, and to meet emergency situations.</P>

<h2><em>health</em></h2>
<P>Health has a variety of definitions, which have been used for different purposes over time.
     In general, it refers to physical and emotional well-being, especially that associated with normal functioning of the human body, absent of disease,
      pain (including mental pain), or injury.
Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical exercise and adequate sleep, 
and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress. Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices, 
such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due to structural causes,
 such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare services.
  Still, other factors are beyond both individual and group choices, such as genetic disorders.</P>
